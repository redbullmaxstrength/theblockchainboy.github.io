I built this website to provide educational and insightful articles on Blockchain technology. Now that the hype over bitcoin has
died down a bit we can take off our party hats and get to work building the future. I will provide technical advice not investment advice. 

I have found in physics and business there are no hitching posts.  You should not expect crypto currency to have a 
hitching post either. Crypto currency is very dynamic and you need to keep up with the news and the latest technology.
This blog will help you keep up. I also want to alert you to the fact Blockchain technology is not accesible to lower income
people and we need to fix that.
